### Customer Transaction Prediction
  - Created a LightGBM model to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted.  
  - The data is anonimyzed, each row containing 200 numerical values identified just with a number.  
  - Target values are imbalanced.  
  - Similar to binary classification problems such as: is a customer satisfied? Will a customer buy this product? Can a customer pay this loan?
