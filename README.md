### Customer Transaction Prediction
  - Created a LightGBM model to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted.  
  - LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms. It is designed to be distributed and efficient with the following advantages:  
    - Faster training speed and higher efficiency.  
    - Lower memory usage.  
    - Better accuracy.  
    - Support of parallel and GPU learning.  
    - Capable of handling large-scale data  
  - The data is anonimyzed, each row containing 200 numerical values identified just with a number.  
  - Target values are imbalanced.  
  - Similar to binary classification problems such as: is a customer satisfied? Will a customer buy this product? Can a customer pay this loan?  
  - Purpose : Helping customers understand their financial health and identify which products and services might help them achieve their monetary goals
